Doomsday is a GNOME panel applet for counting down to an event.

To build and use, first download the source code, get rid of the .git 
directory and this README file, then do:

	cd ..
	dpkg --build <dirname> doomsday-VERSION_all.deb
	
Before you can add it to your panel, you have to either relog or kill 
the panel process.
